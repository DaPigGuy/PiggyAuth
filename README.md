# PiggyAuth <!--[![Poggit-CI](https://poggit.pmmp.io/ci.badge/DaPigGuy/PiggyAuth/PiggyAuth/master)](https://poggit.pmmp.io/ci/DaPigGuy/PiggyAuth)-->

### PROJECT HAS BEEN DISCONTINUED! As of v1.2, xbox auth has been implemented into pmmp; therefore, this plugin will no longer be maintained as there is no need for authentication plugins.
If an individual feature within this plugin is wanted, make a request to @DaPigGuy. He might do it... or you can do it yourself.
